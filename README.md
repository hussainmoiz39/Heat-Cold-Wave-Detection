Data given:

a) Max Temperature

b) Min temperature

c) Average Tempersture


Step 1 -:  To visualize data in arcgis and gstat integrated with qgis. Clean data using python libraries.

Step 2 -:  Interpolation Technique

"Gridded Data" for precip is obtained by interpolation from rain gage data perhaps as spatial averages, in that case you need to know what interpolation method was used and how it was used. Likewise temperature is usually observed at point locations and you only get gridded data by interpolation.

    Spatial Interpretation: Estiamting the value of properties at unsampled space within area covered by observations.
    
    methods:
    
           Point baswd interpolation techniques
           
           a) IDW inverse distance interpolation
           
           b) Spline Interpolation Technique
           
           c) Kriging Interpolation technique
